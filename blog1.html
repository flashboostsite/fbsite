    <h1>5 Signs Your Car Needs a New Battery</h1>
    <div >
        <br>
        <p>As the colder months approach in Toronto, it's important to make sure that your car battery is in good condition. A dead battery can leave you stranded in the middle of a winter storm, which is why it's important to know when you should replace your car battery.

            Typically, a car battery should last between <b>three and five years.</b> However, this can depend on a number of factors such as the type of battery, driving habits, and weather conditions. Here are a few signs that it might be time to replace your car battery:
            
        </p> 
        <br>
        
        <p> <b>1. Slow engine crank:</b> If you notice that your engine is cranking slower than usual, it could be a sign that your battery is starting to fail. This is especially noticeable in colder weather when the battery has to work harder to start the engine. </p>
        
        <br>
            
            
        <p>  <b>2. Dim headlights:</b> If your headlights seem dimmer than usual, it could be a sign that your battery is not providing enough power to your car's electrical system. </p>
            
        <br>
            
            
           <p> <b>3. Check engine light:</b> The check engine light can come on for a number of reasons, but it can also be a sign that your battery is starting to fail. </p>  
            
        <br>    
            
            
           <p> <b>4. Corrosion on battery terminals:</b> If you notice a buildup of white or greenish-blue powdery substance on your battery terminals, it could be a sign that your battery is leaking acid and needs to be replaced. </p>  
            
        <br>    
            
            
         <p> <b>5. Age of battery:</b> As mentioned earlier, car batteries typically last between three and five years. If your battery is getting close to that age, it's a good idea to have it checked and potentially replaced before it fails. </p>
            
        <br>    

       
            
            
         <p> It's always best to have your battery checked by a professional, especially if you're not sure if it needs to be replaced. The last thing you want is to be stranded in the middle of a snowstorm with a dead battery. Stay safe and stay mindful of your car's battery health. </p>
